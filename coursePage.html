			  <td>"User interface design, usability, evaluation, user-centered design."  <i>Basically, I'm learning about HCI while also creating a game of some sort from scratch and implementing HCI concepts to my work. Although I like the concepts discussed in this class about being conscious of who will be using something, I am pretty nervous about the course project of building my own functional game while incorporating HCI elements.</i></td>

			  <td>CSC 4190</td>
			  <td>"With no prior networking knowledge required, this course provides a full overview of computer networking. A top-to-bottom approach is leveraged to understand essential network concepts and protocols, from high-level applications to low-level operational functions, including HTTP, TCP/IP, routing, LAN, wireless, etc. Moreover, you will learn socket programming for data communication." <i>This is a very Information Technology oriented course in my opinion. We're learning about networks and servers so far and I have no idea what any of it means :D so I really don't have anything notable to say about it.</i></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>CSC 5750</td>
			  <td>This class! creating websites from scratch and deploying our work. I guess one noteworthy assignment would have to be this one lol. I enjoyed brushing up (read: relearning) on my HTML skills, and it's made me want to work more on this kind of stuff to refine everything. I am pretty excited to continue to work on the group project for this course where my group will be trying to basically make Goodreads but <b>better</b> :).</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>EET 2720</td>
			  <td>"Use of microprocessors as interface devices, including software, interfaces, memory, registers, and microcomputer system architecture, computer programming design projects."<i>I really liked the first two weeks of the semester where we jsut focused on binary, converting numbers, and adding and subtracting numbers. However, the class mainly deals with circuits and microprocessors, which I know nothing about since getting covid...the programming for the course seems way harder than any of my csc programming classes tho...I wonder why.</i></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>ISM 4575</td>
			  <td>"Provides an investigation of contemporary issues in computer security. Students are exposed to the spectrum of security activities, procedures, and methodologies. Topics include: inspection and protection of information assets; detection of and reaction to threats to information assets; examination of pre- and post-incident procedures, and technical and managerial responses; and an overview of information security planning and staffing functions." <i>This class is basically preparing everyone to take the Comp TIA Security+ examination. So, each week, I've answered questions, done a simulation lab, and taken a quiz. I like the simulation labs as they allow me to get hands-on experience with system management and the likes.</i></td>
